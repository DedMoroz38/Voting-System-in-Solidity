# ♦ Solidity-based Voting System ♦

dApps are becoming more popular these days, so I decided to build one myself. In this case, I used Solidity to interact with smart contracts and Next.js to implement a way to connect and interact with the blockchain through a web interface.

## Running the app
1. **Start the development server**
```bash
$ npm run dev
```
2. **Add Sepolia network in MetaMask (https://chainid.network/ – Sepolia,1115511)**

3. **Add founds to it (https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia)**

4. **Finally open the app, add contract address (*0xA582F3716EE3f6aBDCaAaCaF50f75362bb7B53BD*), link your wallet a vote!**
